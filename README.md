## üõ†Ô∏è Key Highlights

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform provisions VPC, ECS Cluster, Task Definition, and Security Groups.
- **CI/CD Automation**: GitHub Actions builds and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub on every code change.
- **Serverless Deployment**: Medusa backend runs on AWS Fargate with public IP access (port 9000).
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: Scalable, efficient, and easy to manage.
